# grblHAL_CNC3040 [WIP]
Hardware implementation of the grblHAL driver to work with Chinese CNC3040 type of machines  

This project is intended to upgrade any cnc machine that is controlled via parallel port such as the popular chinese CNC3040.  
Instead of having a dedicated LinuxCNC PC or mach32, This device connects directly to the CNC's controller, and can be controlled using any grbl Sender sw via USB connection or even WiFi!  
This device supports an optional stand-alone KeyPad, that is also included in this project.  

This project is based on the great work of @terjeio and his [GrblHAL](https://github.com/grblHAL) project. Thanks!
